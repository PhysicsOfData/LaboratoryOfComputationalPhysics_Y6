    "In other words, the function $f(x)$ is **well-conditioned** if the solution varies gradually as the input varies. For a well-conditioned function, small pertubations in the input result in small effects in the output. However, a poorly-conditioned problem only needs some small perturbation to have large effects. For example, inverting a nearly singluar matrix (a matrix whose determinant is close to zero) is a poorly conditioned problem.\n",

    "Suppose we have a computer algorithm $g(x)$ that represents the mathematical function $f(x)$. $g(x)$ is **numerically stable** if $g(x+\\epsilon) \\simeq f(x)$ and it is called **unstable** if large changes in the output are produced. Analyzing an algorithm for stability is more complicated than determining the condition of an expression, even if the algorithm simply evaluates the expression. This is because an algorithm consists of many basic calculations and each one must be analyzed and, due to roundoff error, we must consider the possibility of small errors being introduced in every computed value.\n",
